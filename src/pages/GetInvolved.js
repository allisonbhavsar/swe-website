With the skills learned from fields such as aerospace, electrical, and computer engineering, the team applied their individual experiences to achieve a single goal - to create the robotic bird. They decided to focus on creating a robotic bird because one of the goals was to create a hands on project that everyone can gain experience from. Over the course of the project, team members became proficient in programs such as Solidworks and Arduino.' },
